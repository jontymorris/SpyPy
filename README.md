# SpyPy

SpyPy gives you basic control over the client computer. It creates a window which displays a live feed of the client's screen. While the live feed window is selected, basic input such as mouse and key presses will be sent to the client's computer.

Because SpyPy uses Pillow's ImageGrab to capture the clients screen, it unlikely to work out of the box on any opearting system other than Windows and MacOS.
